# Algorithms 20290 Code repository 2019/20
This repository is a summary of my work throughout the Spring semester of the Academic year 2019/20 in the module Algorithms COMP20290. It is a combination of the algorithms I worked on during the weekly practical session. These algorithms include sorts, search and compression algorithms.

# Getting Started

### IDE or Text Editor
There are many Java IDE or text editors to choose from, this is up to you based on what you feel comfortable with.<br />
Personally, I prefer Eclipse for Java.<br />
[Downloading and using Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)<br />

### Running Main.java
Open Eclipse, and create a new Java project.<br />
Right click the newly created src folder.<br />
Click Import..<br />
Click General -> File System -> Next.<br />
Click Browse..<br />
Browse to the folder that contains all the content of the repository.<br />
Select that folder.<br />
Tick all the files.<br />
Click Finish.<br />
Open and run Main.java.<br />

### Result
Main.java is a class that allows you to access almost all the other classes in this repository, however it doesn't demonstarte all functionality. It provides basic tests for each algorithm to check that its running correctly with the most simple inputs. These operations in Main.java are not timed or analysed, deep analysis is down using the individual main methods for each class, then discussed in the docx for each practical **in red**. <br />

When you run Main.java a menu system pops up, you are promoted to select which program you want to run and test, the tests are all precoded and explained when executed. You can run as many test as you would like, 0 is entered to exit the program.<br />

# Contents
### Overview
- Main.java to quickly run and test all files.
- Each practical has its own java file named after it (Practical 3 and 9 have 2 files each).
- Practical two has its own folder 'Prac2' which contains all the files needed to run it.
- Practical nine has its own folder 'Prac9extras' which contains all the resultant files from running it i.e. bin files
- Each practical has its own filled in .docx file, it includes results analyis and answers to relevant short questions.
### Detailed
Prac1.java

# Notes
The word documents contains:
- Results analysis of the code for each lab (Graphs, tables, etc.) (**In red**)
- Some of them contain answered short questions about the relevant topic.
